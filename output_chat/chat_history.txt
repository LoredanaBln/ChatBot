User: Tell be about frequency changes
Assistant: Using the following context, provide a clear and concise answer to the question. Focus only on information present in the context.

Context: • Data cache and instruction cache: if the code or data are not in the cache, the cycle count
is much larger.
• Context switches: if they occur during measurement, the result will be biased.
• Frequency changes: results are not accurate if there are frequency changes during measure-
ment.
• Multi-core processors: the cycle counters on the cores are not synchronized. If the process
migrates during measurement, the result will be wrong.

If the processors support technologies that make possible to change the frequency while functioning
(for power management), the execution time measurement is affected. The solution for this problem
is to prevent frequency changes through the settings in the operating system. If the measurement is
made in clock cycles, not in seconds, the measurement will be independent of the processor frequency.

Question: Tell be about frequency changes

Answer: This can help you understand how many times each core has been used by an application (e., memory) at one point; it also helps you determine what happens when all CPUs have changed their clocks twice per second over several years as well!
